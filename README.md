# DanBot Hosting Bots API
Welcome to the official DanBot Hosting Bots API!
This is the server-side project that allows users to add their own bot into our [Community Server](https://discord.gg/dbh)!

> ⚠️ This project is still in a testing stage. It should be good enough for production, but bugs may occur.
> 🚨 Found a bug? Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/DanBot-Hosting/DBH-BOT-API/issues/new). Found a vulnerability? Open a ticket in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dbh) (Soon enough on a support website!)
